// The match() function takes in two parameters: text and pattern.
// Inside the function, we initialize a count variable to 0 and an i variable to 0. The i variable is used as an index to iterate over the text string.
// We then use a while loop to iterate over the text string, checking each substring of length len(pattern) to see if it matches the pattern string.
// If a match is found, we increment the count variable by 1 and increase the i variable by len(pattern) to skip over the matched substring.
// If no match is found, we simply increase the i variable by 1 to move to the next character in the text string.
// Once the entire text string has been processed, we return the count variable, which represents the number of times the pattern string was found in the text string.
// In summary, the algorithm works by iterating over the text string, checking for matches of the pattern string, and keeping track of the count of matches found.
